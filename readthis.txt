A-star potential algorithm is implemented on a real time robot.
This link shows the robot moving in our college corridor while implementing the path generated by the Algorithm.

Run the files rrt.py, A-star-potential.py in their respective folders to see the simulation of both algorithms.
Paths generated by both these algorithms have to be scaled to real world dimensions and a provision is provided in them.
The output from these algorithms is taken as nodes(joining these nodes results in path from start to goal).
These nodes are sent to arduino which helps in movement of robot in real world environment.
In upcoming version the plan is to make the robot move in a dynamic environment using CUDA for computing the path.
